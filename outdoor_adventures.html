              In Kommetjie Bay expect the Cape snoek run in the winter season and you can catch white steenbras, stumpnose & galjoen off the rocks at Kommetjie but if you wish to fish off boats and really fight for your line, take a charter 30 nautical miles out from Kommetjie where you can enjoy some of the best deep-sea fishing grounds of the Cape Peninsula and these are home to tuna, albacore, black marlin and the fighting mako shark.

          <p>Newlands Forest </p>
          <p>In the midst of the trees deep in the forest is a stone cottage that the woodcutter and his family live in (as well as their slave, this is the 1700s after all). Built by the Dutch East India Company this house in the woods is called Paradise. The master woodcutter is entrusted with the job of protecting the valuable timber resources of Table Mountain.</p>
          <p>Fast forward to the end of the decade and Lady Anne Barnard is recording her brief stay in the stone cottage. This diary entry was passed down and over the years the cottage has become known as Lady Anne Barnyard’s Cottage despite her short stay there.</p>
          <p>Avid hikers use the forest as an entry to the four unique trails that wind up the mountain. These trails range from easy to moderate, and boast several vantage points along the way that offer exquisite views stretching from the city centre to Blouberg.</p>

          <p>Leisurely strollers entering the forest from the parking area will come across a sign with information detailing the various routes. The easier routes are made up of interlinking paths, with a few streams in between, and stunning views of the surrounding suburbs. Dogs are welcome as long as owners are carrying an activity permit otherwise they will be fined.</p>

          <p>Get ready to rock at CityROCK indoor climbing gym in Cape Town. With hundreds of routes, overhanging climbing sections and over 450m² of climbing area, the indoor climbing gym is the largest of its kind in South Africa.</p>
          <p>Strapped into a climbing harness with metres of vertical horizon before you, your first instinct is to keep both feet firmly on the ground. But once you’ve taken the first step up onto the first of many colourful landing spots that jut out from the ‘rock’ surface you feel a sense of power. An overwhelming determination to climb and keep climbing sets in and you’re off to reach your own personal summit.</p>
          <p>Indoor climbing is sure to get your blood pumping and your muscles working. If you’re a novice climber, make sure you don’t make any plans that involve too much moving around in the days to come after your first climb.</p>
          <p>After years of neglect, those climbing muscles will be stiff the next day and while at first you may be cursing your newfound love of heights, the adrenalin and sense of accomplishment after a climb will have you going back for more each week.
          Climbing is a popular form of rock climbing performed on artificial structures that, in a controlled environment, attempts to mimic the experience of real rock climbing. If you’re thinking of doing the real thing and climbing your way up Table Mountain, this is a great way to practice before you take the plunge.
          CityROCK in Cape Town has separate adult and kids bouldering caves, which ensure that all ages can climb comfortably at their own pace.</p>
          <p>The indoor climbing arena in Cape Town also offers expert climbing advice, as well as introductory courses, outdoor courses, gear shop, yoga, corporate teambuilding, kids programs and birthday parties.
